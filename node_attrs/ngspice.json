Digital circuits are simulated as well, event driven and fast, from\n    single gates to complex circuits. And you may enter the combination of both analog\n    and digital as a mixed-signal circuit.\n    \n    ngspice offers a wealth of device models for active, passive, analog, and digital\n    elements. Model parameters are provided by the semiconductor manufacturers.\n    The user add her circuits as a netlist, and the output is one or more graphs of\n    currents, voltages and other electrical quantities or is saved in a data file.\n\n    Note:\n      This build was configured with --enable-xspice --enable-cider --enable=openmp\n      See the [build script](https://git.io/Jf0vv) for more specifics.\n\nextra:\n  recipe-maintainers:\n    - stuarteberg\n"
